# leaflet-challenge

Using data from USGS API "https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php" - the challenge is to create maps to visualise earthquake data using Leaflet and Mapbox in JS.

I have created two maps for this challenge:

Step-1 code creates a singular graysclae map that displays earthquake activity for the past seven days, with each earthquake represented in magnitude by both size and colour. 

Step-2 code rexreates the map from step-1 but with three different base layer maps "Streets", "Dark", and "Satellite", and also adds tectonic plate data as a separate GeoJSON layer
